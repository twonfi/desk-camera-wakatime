# Desk Camera WakaTime
This is a WakaTime extension for paper.

## Is this a joke?
Yes.

For context, I started making this after someone on Slack joked about a pencil and paper WakaTime extension.

It's probably not going to work, and please do not use it for Hack Club.
I intentionally made it incompatible with Hackatime.

## When will this be finished?
I will be working on it randomly during my free time (almost non-existent for me) while I try to figure out the WakaTime API and the camera library.

## Will this be submitted to a YSWS?
No, because of fraud implications.
